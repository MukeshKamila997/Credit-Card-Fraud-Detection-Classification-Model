# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Classification-Model

* Building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card
transactions.
* Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class
imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random
forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall,
and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or
undersampling for improving results.
